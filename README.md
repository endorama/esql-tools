# ES|QL Tools

Tools for using the [Elasticsearch Query Language](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/esql.html) (ES|QL.)

This repository contains _highly experimental_ software for using ES|QL on the command line or in text editor and IDE environments.

Nothing here is supported by Elastic. The tools provided here are meant for educational purposes. Any suggestions or enhancements are welcome, but this is a small side project so don't expect much.

The purpose of these tools is to provide useful ways to use ES|QL everywhere and to explore interaction possibilities outside the web browser.

The tools here currently are:

* [esqshell](./esqshell): A command line tool for running ES|QL queries.
* [esql-syntax-highlighting](./esql-syntax-highlighting): Visual Studio Code extension for ES|QL syntax highlighting.
